Welcome to the **Daily Vibe Blog Web App**! This is a simple and stylish blog platform where you can share what song describes your day to an accumulating. It is intended to be a fun way to keep track of what mood you've been feeling and what tune captures it the most. Hopefully, in the future, your blog can be viewable to other users!

This project showcases the skills I obtained from FreeCodeCamp's _Responsive Web Design_ and _Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures_ Certification. I leveraged HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project!



If you have any suggestions for the web application or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me at reynaoaguirre@gmail.com.
